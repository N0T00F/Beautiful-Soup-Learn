# Beautiful Soup Learning 

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my progress in mastering web scraping using Python's **Beautiful Soup**. 

My primary goal is to take unstructured data from the web and convert it into **clean, readable, and appealing tables** (DataFrames) for analysis.

## 🚧 Project Status
> **Note:** The code in this repository reflects my current learning curve. 
> Some approaches may be brute-force or "immature" as I am still grasping the key concepts. I am actively working on refactoring and optimizing these scripts as I learn more about:
> * Handling dynamic content
> * Selecting stable CSS selectors
> * Optimizing data cleaning pipelines

## 📂 Contents
This repository includes:
* **Mini-Projects:** Small, focused scripts inspired by open-source community examples.
* **Tutorial Code:** Practice files based on tutorials (specifically the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) web scraping curriculum).
* **Data Transformation:** Examples of converting raw HTML soup into structured Pandas DataFrames.

## 📚 Resources & Credits
The logic and structure of these projects were heavily inspired by:
* **freeCodeCamp** (YouTube Tutorials) as you can see in chaoticfiles.
* Open-source community projects and public scraping guides.
